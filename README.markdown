# CSS HELPER

### The CSS can be easily exhautive by its length of code. To avoid the overscrolling I drop here a simple method.

> **The code is organized in many sections labeled by comments** : 
> * RESET
> * COLORS
> * FONTS
> * SPACES
> * CONTAINERS
> * ITEMS


 So you can just do `âŒ˜F` to reach the section you want easily
